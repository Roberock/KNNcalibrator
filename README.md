# Problem statement 


We will assume we have access to:
1. $\mathcal{M}: x_a,x_e,x_c \rightarrow y $ a high-fidelity (or surrogate) simulation model;
2. $D^{s}$ a database of input-output simulations from this model;
3. $\mathcal{D}^{e}(x_c)$ a data set with empirical output-design pairs for a design $x_c$.


We will then present procedures for given-data:
- **Stochastic model updating**
- **Design of experiment procedure**


**The computational model**

We assume the model is a high-fidelity model or a surrogate.
This model replicates the behaviour of a real system, also referred to as the environment.
The model $\mathcal{M}$ takes as inputs $x=(x_a,x_e,x_c)\in \mathcal{X}$, a vector with aleatoric variables (distributed with an unknown PDF) $x_a\in\mathcal{X}_a \subset\mathbb{R}^{n_a}$, epistemic uncertain vector (assumed fixed value but unknown) $x_e\in\mathcal{X}_e \subset\mathbb{R}^{n_e}$,
design vector (controllable parameters) $x_c\in \mathcal{X}_c \subset \mathbb{R}^{n_c}$. This model is deterministic, i.e., one-input one-output, and for each $x$ it returns a matrix $y \in \mathcal{Y} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n_y\times T}$,
which are $n_y$ trajectories over $T$ timesteps.

**Simulated and empirical data**

A database of input-output responses from this model is provided as follows $D^{s} =\{x_i,y_i\}_{i=1}^{n_{s}}$, where $n_s$ is the number of input-output paris.
Assume this data set is simulated by uniform sampling $x \in \mathcal{X}$

 
Empirical data is also gathered by the environment, $\mathcal{M}^{true}: x_c \rightarrow Y$, 
by selecting a design $x_c$, where $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{n_y\times T\times N }$ are $N$ samples of $y$.
For a selected design $x_{c}$, an experiment on an environment produces 
a data set $ \mathcal{D}^{e}(x_c) = \{ x_{c}, Y \}$.

Note that $Y$ are random matrices and are assumed generated by sampling
$\mathbf{x}_a \sim f_a^\star$ the ture probability distribution $f_a^\star$ 
and by fixing the epistemic components to the true epistemic vector $x_e=x_e^\star$.

$$ ~ $$

**Target - Calibrate an uncertainty model**

The objective is to calibrate an uncertainty model for $x_e$ and for $x_a$. For instance, this can be a model $UM: = \langle E, f_a\rangle$ 
where $f_a$ is probability density for the aleatoric components and $E$ a set. 
 
**Experimental budget**

We will index by $q=0,1,...,n_q$ design queries (experiments) carried out on the environment, 
and by $\mathcal{D}^{e}_q$ the empirical data from experiment $q$. 


**Scoring and UM selection**

Ideally, the model $ \langle E, f_a\rangle$ should be as close as possible to the target $ \langle x_e^\star, f_a^\star \rangle$.
